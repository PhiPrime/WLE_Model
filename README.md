The goal of this project is to use the data from the Weight Lifting Excersise collected by Velloso, E. et. al. to create a model that can determine if an individual is correctly lifting weights (Data from: Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H. Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises. Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI (Augmented Human '13) . Stuttgart, Germany: ACM SIGCHI, 2013.  )
